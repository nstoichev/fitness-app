# Product Overview Specification

## Purpose

This application is a personal training and workout planning system.
Users create workouts, schedule them in a calendar, execute them, and log performance.
The system tracks training load, muscle fatigue, and recovery over time.

The product prioritizes:
- clarity over automation
- user agency over prescriptive guidance
- long-term training sustainability

## Core Principles

- The system does not dictate weights or intensity.
- The user always chooses how hard to train.
- Timers assist execution but do not define success.
- Fatigue indicators are informational, not warnings.
- All derived data must be explainable.

## User Types

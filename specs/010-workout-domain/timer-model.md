# Timer Model

## Timer Generation Rules

A workout generates a global timer only if:
- all segments are time-bindable

## Segment Timer Behavior

- Countdown timers (AMRAP, capped segments)
- Count-up timers (For Time without cap)
- Interval-based timers (EMOM, Fartlek)

## Execution Rules

- Timer starts on user action
- Timer may auto-advance between segments
- User may manually finish a segment if required

Timer is an execution aid, not a validation mechanism.
